# **Implementation of LinkedList**

The project contains two implementations of the linked list interface:
1. **LinkedListArray** - based on an array
2. **CircularSinglyLinkedList** - a circular singly linked list

Both implementations support a full set of operations:
- Adding/removing elements (`append`, `insert`, `delete`)
- Searching for elements (`findFirst`, `findLast`)
- Reversing the list (`reverse`)
- Cloning the list (`clone`)
- Merging lists (`extend`)

## **Variant Calculation**
I am 8th in my group list.

The variant number is calculated using the formula:
```
Result = 8 mod 4 = 0
```
Thus, my variant for this assignment is **0**.

Based on this variant, the following implementations were created:
- **CircularSinglyLinkedList** – Circular singly linked list
- **LinkedListArray** – Singly linked list based on an array

## **Unit Test Conclusions**

### **Advantages:**
✅ Identified critical bugs
✅ Fast logic validation
✅ Facilitated refactoring

### **Disadvantages:**
❌ Time-consuming to write
❌ Challenging to test edge cases
❌ Requires ongoing test maintenance

### **Summary:**
Unit tests are worth the effort, especially for complex data structures and projects with frequent changes.
